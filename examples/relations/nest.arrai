# nesting is the only grouping operator in arrai

{|a, b, c|
 (1, 2, 3),
 (1, 2, 4),
 (2, 2, 4)
}
nest |a, b|ab

# = {(ab: {(a: 1, b: 2)}, c: 3), (ab: {(a: 1, b: 2), (a: 2, b: 2)}, c: 4)}
# explanation: nesting groups the nested attributes into a single attribute
# The new nested attribute contains all instances of a,b for each c.
