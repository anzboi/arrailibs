# This lambda takes a pattern as input and will match its input against the pattern
# In this case, it will match against the 'a' attribute of each tuple, binding the value to 'value'
# The '...' tells the pattern to match against anything else in the tuple and ignore it.
# This is useful if your input is complicated and you only care about a few particular values.
